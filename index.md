I'm Izzy Lively, a freelance writer and neurodivergent content creator from Kaufman, TX. Also the "queen of [short domains](/domains/)".

## Stop motion animation
I create stop motion Reels digitally and post the results to [my Instagram account](//instagram.com/xoizzyco/). I have two process videos: [one](https://www.instagram.com/p/CeFfSWhjOwR/) / [two](https://www.instagram.com/p/CeQG9uGDF2W/).

## Writing
My primary beats are neurodiversity, blogging and SEO, and accessible environmentalism.
