I'm Jane Lively, a freelance writer and neurodivergent content creator from Kaufman, TX. Also the "queen of [short domains](/domains/)".

## Web dev
I have contributed open-source software to the online trading card community, to simplify processes for TCG owners. Additionally, I design for WordPress and create plugins for any custom functionality (shortcodes, taxonomies, email cloaking, etc.).

**Contributions include:**
