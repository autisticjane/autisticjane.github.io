          <p>that's what my old boss told me when i was trying to tell him about something important that happened</p>
          <p>it was super unhelpful in rectifying the circumstance</p>
          <p>this 404 is also unhelpful</p>
          <p>but those who know me recognize how on brand this is</p>
          <p><small>(not being unhelpful; rather 404 pages = tools that are usually entirely unhelpful)</small></p>
          <p><small>(<a href="//twitter.com/thejanelively/">tweet me</a> if you landed here from something i linked so i can rectify it,
            because rectifying &amp; getting shit done is what i do. i need to stop saying this word.)</small></p>
