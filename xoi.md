# XO, IZZY

Hi, I’m Izzy Lively. I create content for neurodivergent individuals who desperately want to live independently by giving them the tools they need to accomplish that — while figuring it out for myself in the process.

I'm in the process of rebranding/creating something new. My blog is my resume, and I want to be proud of it. My past is my history. To end the cycle and constant spiralling, I need to create something that represents who I am now, my passion and what I want to do in life. What my blog i is currently doesn't help make my dreams come true. It doesn't spread abuse awareness of autism acceptance. It doesn't nourish my soul.

Stepping out of the box doesn't mean anything.

Here's to actually breaking the box down.

Coming summer 2022.

Until then, find me on social media @xoizzyco:
