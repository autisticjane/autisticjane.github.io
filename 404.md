## "oh, we can't do that"
that's what my old boss told me when i was trying to tell him about something important that happened

it was super unhelpful in rectifying the circumstance

this 404 is also unhelpful

[tweet me](https://twitter.com/xoizzyco/) or [create an issue](https://github.com/izzylively/izzylively.github.io/issues/new) if you landed here from something i linked so I can rectify it
