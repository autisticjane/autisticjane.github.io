<p>Hi, I’m Izzy Lively. I create content for neurodivergent individuals who desperately want to live independently by giving them the tools they need to accomplish that — while figuring it out for myself in the process.</p>

<p>I'm in the process of rebranding/creating something new. My blog is my resume, and I want to be proud of it. My past is my history. To end the cycle and constant spiralling, I need to create something that represents who I am now, my passion and what I want to do in life. What my blog i is currently doesn't help make my dreams come true. It doesn't spread abuse awareness of autism acceptance. It doesn't nourish my soul.</p>

<p>Stepping out of the box doesn't mean anything.</p>

<p>Here's to actually breaking the box down.</p>

<p>Coming summer 2022.</p>

<p>Until then, find me on social media @xoizzyco:</p>
