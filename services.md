## Freelance writing
I write articles in the autism niche for parents. My rate is $0.085 USD per word. I do **not** offer rapid turnarounds on account of being an *actually autistic* individual.

## Roundup injection
I will add your relevant blog posts to blog roundup posts in Facebook groups. You will receive access to a spreadsheet of what your site was added to so you can keep up.

I take on a limited number of clients per month at a rate of $100/ea. and a guaranteed minimum of 50 links. Link submission depends highly on your blog's content.

## Terms
* **No refunds.**
  * If paid in full, no refunds after I begin working on project or after project is sent.
  * Deposits are non-refundable.
* **New clients must pay for project in full.**
  * Returning clients who have had a derogatory invoice in the past 6-12 months will be asked to pay for the project in full.
* Services are delivered digitally.
* Services are delivered in English only.
* Services will not be delivered rapidly upon request, even if larger compensation is offered.
* Services **may be delayed 24-72 hours in the event of an autism meltdown**, which requires me to rest properly and practice self-care so as to not have the functioning capacity of a potato. Considering my freelance writing niche, this should be expected.
* I reserve the right to refuse projects for any reason at my own discretion, undisclosed.
* **I do not offer pro bono or free work** unless I've approached a client with this opportunity.
* I reserve the right to update this policy without notice.
