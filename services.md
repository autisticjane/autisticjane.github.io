## Freelance writing
I write articles in the autism niche for parents. My rate is $0.08 USD per word. I do **not** offer rapid turnarounds on account of being an *actually autistic* individual.

If I am ghostwriting and you decide to give me a byline, the following terms apply per piece:
1. Do not add any links pertaining to Autism Speaks, *Age of Autism*, or other organizations that I tell you are harmful **unless I link to them myself**.
2. Do not reference the puzzle piece in the written content, an opt-in within the content, and/or a graphic. Obviously, sidebar and header content are different *unless it's obvious these references do not show up on most other posts*.
3. You must not change the meaning of the post.
4. Do not change identity-first language (IFL) to person-first language (PFL) without my consent.
5. I may add additional terms to this situation on a per-project basis.

**I only link to live, published samples with my byline by default.** If you are okay with me linking to your live, ghostwritten piece, you must tell me.

## Roundup injection
I will add your relevant blog posts to blog roundup posts in Facebook groups. You will receive access to a spreadsheet of what your site was added to so you can keep up.

I take on a limited number of clients per month at a rate of $100/ea. and a guaranteed minimum of 50 links. Link submission possibility depends highly on your blog's content. **I will also provide a list of roundups you did not have content for.**

**Must be paid in full upfront.** No deposit options available unless reserving multiple months in advance, at which point half would be due before the first month and the remainder would be due halfway through term.
* 10% off for 3-month term ($270)

## Terms
* **No refunds.**
  * If paid in full, no refunds after I begin working on project or after project is sent.
  * Deposits are non-refundable.
* **New clients must pay for project in full.**
  * Returning clients who have had a derogatory invoice in the past 6-12 months will be asked to pay for the project in full.
* Services are delivered digitally.
* Services are delivered in English only.
* Services **will not be delivered rapidly upon request**, even if larger compensation is offered, unless I excplitily offer it.
* Services **may be delayed 24-72 hours in the event of an autism meltdown**, which requires me to rest properly and practice self-care so as to not have the functioning capacity of a potato. **Considering my freelance writing niche, this should be expected.**
* I reserve **the right to refuse projects** for any reason at my own discretion, undisclosed.
* **I do not offer pro bono or free work** unless I've approached a client with this opportunity.
* I reserve the **right to update this policy** without notice/disclosure.
