## About this wiki
This wiki was created by [portia](//tcg.lemonandlively.com/)/[Jane](//lemonandlively.com/) to offer a cleaner TCG wiki that explains things a bit further than the original fandom, and focuses less on ‚Äúeverything TCG‚Äù and more on the mechanics.

It‚Äôs about creating a hub of info for newcomers to learn about online TCGs and maybe even join, so we can expand the community again. üôÉ
